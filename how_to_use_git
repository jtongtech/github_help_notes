Intro to Git and github

Download git from here https://git-scm.com/downloads

To clone a repo
    click green button on right side of screen that says clone repo
    copy the url that is displayed in a popup
    navigate to the folder where you keep your code in powershell
    enter following command where URL is the url you copied

    git clone URL


To initiate a repo
    build out your file structure in a minimal way
    navigate to folder in powershell
    go to github
    click new repository button
    click initiate with readme
    copy first big chunk of code in grey box
    paste in your powershell and hit enter
    once complete, enter the following commands

    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push origin master

    now reload your page on github and marvel at the fact your code is on github!

To push your existing project to existing repo
    navigate to the folder in powershell
    enter following commands

    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git pull origin master
    git push origin master

*** IMPORTANT ***

    You must pull and push often.  DO NOT keep code on you machine for more than 30 minutes to an hour without pushing it out.  This will cause merge conflicts and potentially cause major problems for you and your teammates.  Ideally, you make a change, run your test, pull from git, then push for every change.  Not big changes but little ones.  Be descriptive on you commit messages.  Your team should be able to tell exactly what you did by looking at your commit messages.  DO NOT PUSH WITH OUT PULLING FIRST.  This will overwrite changes your team has made.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER DO A FORCE PUSH OR A RESET BY YOURSELF.  These have very big consequences and must be agreed upon by your team and be done together.
